Hello this change was made on my local machine!

GIT is a version management system.

Download:

git version

git status

git pull

Push changes to main

git status *check up to date*

git add [filename] *add to commit*

git commit -m "commit message here" *commit message*

git status *to check*

git push *push to github*

Change Branch

git push --set-upstream origin "branchname"


Alternatives to GIT:

Azure Devops Server - closed source focussed rather than open focus for Git, Git more user friendly.

Mercurial - cant change history, potentially more tamper proof than git
